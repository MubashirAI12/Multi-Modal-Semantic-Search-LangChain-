# Multi-Modal-Semantic-Search-LangChain-
This project implements a multi-modal semantic search system that supports PDF, CSV, and image files. Utilizing LangChain for document loading, splitting, and vector storage with Qdrant, it enables efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide contextually accurate answers using HuggingFace embeddings and a Ollama large language model.
